                        C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. 
                        C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in the .
                        NET ecosystem. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. 
                        This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 8 and earlier. 
                        If you want to explore the language through interactive examples,
                        try the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/" target="_blank">introduction to C#</a> tutorials.

                        C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. 
                        Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices.

                    Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/">Garbage collection</a> 
                    automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects. 
                    Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects.

                        C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance. C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.

                            <p>No doubt you’ve found programming languages that offer their own set of advantages, maybe even a few of the same advantages of using C#. There are comparable languages out there, like Python, that also provide simplicity and other benefits. Why should you choose to learn C# instead of an alternative?</p>

                        In C# memory management is performed automatically by the garbage collector. 
                        If the programmer creates an object and after the completion of that object’s task the garbage collector will automatically delete that object.C# code is windows specific. Although Microsoft is working to make it global but till now the major system does not provide support for C#.C# does not support any multiple inheritances through classes.C# is used to develop mobile, windows, and console applications.
                      </p>     
                      <p>In C++ memory management is performed manually by the programmer. If a programmer creates an object then he is responsible to destroy that object after the completion of that object’s task.C++ code can be run on any platform. C++ is used where the application needed to directly communicate with hardware.	In C++ bound checking is not performed by compiler. By mistake, if the programmer tries to access invalid array index then it will give the wrong result but will not show any compilation error.C++ is typically used for console applications.</p>
                      <p>C# is a pure object-oriented programming language.C# code gets converted into intermediate language code after compilation.C# is used to develop mobile, windows, and console applications.</p>

                        <p>The Hello World! program is the most basic and first program when you dive into a new programming language. This simply prints the Hello World! on the output screen. In C#, a basic program consists of the following</p>
                        <code>
                            using System;
                            namespace HelloWorldApp {
                                class Geeks {

                                        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); 
                                        Console.ReadKey(); 
                                </code>

                                <p>A typical program uses various values that may change during its execution. For example, a program that performs some operations on the values entered by the user. The values entered by one user may differ from those entered by another user. Hence this makes it necessary to use variables as another user may not use the same values. When a user enters a new value that will be used in the process of operation, can store temporarily in the Random Access Memory of computer and these values in this part of memory vary throughout the execution and hence another term for this came which is known as Variables. So basically, a Variable is a placeholder of the information which can be changed at runtime. And variables allows to Retrieve and Manipulate the stored informatio</p>
                                <code>
                                    type variable_name = value; 
                                   or
                                type variable_names
                                </code>
                                <p>The term initializing means to assign some value to the variable. Basically, the actual use of variables comes under the initialization part. In C# each data type has some default value which is used when there is no explicitly set value for a given variable. Initialization can be done separately or may be with declaration.</p>
                                <code>
                                    int y = 7; // Declaring and initializing the variable at same time<br>
                                    int x; // Declaring variable x<br>
                                    x = 5; // initializing x with value 5
                                </code>
                                <p>It means to provide the value to the variable during the compilation of the program. If the programmer didn’t provide any value then the compiler will provide some default value to the variables in some cases. Generally, this type of initialization helpful when the programmer wants to provide some default value.</p>

                            You can declare a variable in three ways:
                            <p>  With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                                can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                            <p><p>
                                By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                                always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                                warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                              </p> With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                              can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                              below.</p>

                                    <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                                        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                                        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                                        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                                        function.</p>
                                    <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                                        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                                        global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                                        code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                                        context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                                        is an if statement.</p>
                                        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                                    <p>is behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                                        ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                                        <code>
                                         if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                                          defined</code>

                        <article>
                            <p>
                                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                                pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                                variables using the window.variable syntax.
                              </p>
                        
                              <p>
                                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
                                frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
                                name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
                                document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                                parent.phoneNumber.

                                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                                    syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                                    can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                                  </p>
                                  <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                                  <p>
                                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                                    while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                                    variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                                    represent a variable.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                                    variable in the same scope. For example:
                                  </p>
                                  <code>
                                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                                    CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                                    }

                                  However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                                  is executed without problems.
                                  <code>
                                    const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";

                                    <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Six data types that are primitives:
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    Boolean. true and false.`
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                                                    is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                                                    other variant.
                                                  </li>
                                                  <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                                                  <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                                                  <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                                                  <li>
                                                    Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                                                    unique and immutable.
                                                  </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>and Object</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                                    to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                                    are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                                    objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                                    your application can perform.

                                      Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                                       true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                                     is false. An if statement looks as follows:
                                     <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                                     condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                                          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                                           condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                                         statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                                                   including further nested if statements.
                                             <code></code>
                                       if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                                                  } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                                              </code>
                                              In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                                              evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                                              them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                                              to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
                                              <code>
                                                if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                                                    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                                                    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                                                    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                                              </code>
                                              It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
                                              because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
                                              the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                                              <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
                                              If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                                                  additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

                                     <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

                                        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
                                        evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
                                  
                                        <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
                                        statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                                        statement following the loop.
                                  
                                        <p>
                                          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                                          the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
                                          tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                                          control is passed to the statement following while.
                                        </p>
                                  
                                        <p>
                                          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
                                          those statements.
                                        </p>
                                  
                                        Example:
                                  
                                        <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
                                  
                                        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                                        <p>
                                          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                                          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                                        </p>
                                  
                                        <ul>
                                          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                                          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                                          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>
                                          After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                                          true, so the loop terminates.
                                        </p>

                                    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                                    statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
                              
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>The name of the function.</li>
                                      <li>
                                        A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                                        separated by commas.
                                      </li>
                                      <li>
                                        The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                                        brackets, { }.
                                      </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                      For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                                    </p>
                              
                                    <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                                    <p>
                                      The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                                      consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                                      function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                                      specifies the value returned by the function.
                                    </p>
                                    <code>return number * number;</code>
                                    <p>
                                      Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                                      value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
                                      the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
                                      the calling function.
                                    </p>
